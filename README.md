## General Information
-This project implemented by react.js and javaScript. 
-In this Project tried to use all of Hooks such as (useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext, useReducer).
-used conditional rendering and ternary operator
-used some npm packages such az Axios for fetching data and Toastify to alert messages .
-create responsible design for mobil device with media query 
-used regex for validation input
-use Memoization for improving the performance
I am also able to implement this project with TypeScript and some library for Css such as Material UI and preprocessor css such as Sass.
I can use Routing for SPA application and use another hooks such as useCalback and useMemo.
////
Blinq's color palette is used for the website theme.
The buttons have a hover. After pressing the resquest button, the form appears using conditional rendering. And the auto focus is on the name field. For this reason, the error that the name is requierd is notified first. Errors are notified in two ways. Using Notify and message inline, all inputs are validated. At first, the send button is inactive. After filling all the fields correctly, the send button becomes active. After the send button is activated, using Axios has sent the request and the send button will be in waiting mode. After the request is sent correctly and the response is 200, a success message will be notified and another window will appear.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
